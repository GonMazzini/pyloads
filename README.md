# Python package for calculating the static loads for a wind turbine blade. 
# note: the POWER CURVE is not working in the last release. !
# The DTU 10 MW is used as an example for computing:
- Normal and tangential loads
- Power coefficient
- Thrust coefficient
- Power curve plot for WTG.

note: This project is in the early phase of the development.
The aim is to provide tools for evaluation of different airfoils profile and find optimal 
cord length as function of radial position.
